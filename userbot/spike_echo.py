spike_echo.py - step 0 of the userbot: does Telegram 1-on-1 audio work at all?

No SIP, no gateway, no bridge. It answers a call from the owner and plays their
own voice back at them, delayed by the buffer. That single test proves the two
things everything else is built on:

  * outbound works  - you hear anything at all
  * inbound works   - what you hear is YOUR voice, not silence

Inbound is the half that historically fails (pytgcalls/ntgcalls#44). If you hear
nothing, the call still "connects" and the logs still look healthy, which is
exactly why this is worth proving before writing the SIP bridge.

Run it, call the userbot account from a normal Telegram client, and talk.

    cd userbot
    cp config.example.json config.json     # fill in api_id / api_hash / phone / owner_id
    python spike_echo.py

First run asks for the login code Telegram sends you. The session is cached
afterwards, and that session file is equivalent to the account.

Telegram Web A negotiates a protocol version ntgcalls does not speak - answer
from a phone or the desktop client.
